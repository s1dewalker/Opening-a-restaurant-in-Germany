### Hypothesis: Suggesting top locations that could give some advantage <br/>
(Location is a key factor for opening any restaurant.)
<br/>
### Data Available: Top 50 restaurants of a city with some details<br/>
(Using 2 APIs)
<br/>

### Data Analysis: Data Transformation, applying clustering algorithm, and observing <br/>
Transformed cuisine data for each restaurant into categories. <br/> Applying K-Mode clustering.<br/>
Main clusters in the latest clustering: <br/>
<br/>
_CLUSTER 0: most bar, most European, no Asian, most German, no Italian_ <br/>
_CLUSTER 1: most top-ranked, most top-rated, most cafe, most Healthy_ <br/>
_CLUSTER 2: no top-ranked, least top-rated, no bar, no cafe, no European, all Asian, no American, no German, no Mediterranean, no Italian_ <br/>
_CLUSTER 3: most bars, most steakhouses, least Gluten Free Options, least Healthy, most American_ <br/>
_CLUSTER 4: no bar, most seafood, no Asian, no American, most Mediterranean, most Italian_ <br/>

__KEY OBSERVATIONS__ <br/>
* __Cafes were the most top rated__
* __Top-ranked restaurants were mostly having healthy, seafood, Mediterranean, or Italian cuisines__
* __Bars were mostly German__
* __Asian cuisines were least ranked and least top rated__

### Synthesis: Providing sensible suggestions after observation <br/>
* __Best option would be to open a cafe or restaurant with healthy/seafood/Mediterranean/Italian cuisines__
* __Bars would be a competitive market with local German and European cuisines__
* __Avoid or have fewer Asian cuisines__

### After observing the clusters from the map:
Few suggestions based on demographic and competition; ignoring budget, accessibility, crime, size and space requirements, or other data that is not available <br/>
Demographics: If your target audience consists of students then consider opening an inexpensive restaurant.<br/>
Competition: If the area has more top-rated and top-ranked restaurants then either avoid or find a way to funnel the people to your location. <br/>
Few examples of points of interest:<br/>
(purple: most top-ranked, most top-rated | red: no top ranked, least top rated | green: others)

<br/>
1. Berlin <br/>
A lot of the city has top-class restaurants, especially in the heart of the city. But near Tegel airport there is none. Might need to find a way to attract the audience from these other locations.<br/>

<br/>
2. Munich <br/>
The area around LMU (Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich), TU Munich (Technical University of Munich), and Munich Main Station. Could potentially attract students and other crowds to an inexpensive restaurant.<br/>

<br/>
3. Frankfurt <br/>
Most of the city has top-class restaurants spread all over. Either avoid or find a way to funnel the people to your location.<br/>
