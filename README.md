### Hypothesis <br/>
Suggesting top locations that could give some advantage <br/>
_(Location and cuisine types are key factors for opening any restaurant.)_
<br/>
### Data <br/> 
Top 50 restaurants of a city with some details<br/>
[Data Extraction & Data Transformation](https://github.com/s1dewalker/Opening-a-restaurant-in-Germany/blob/main/Data%20Extraction%20and%20Transformation.ipynb) <br/>
_(2 APIs, Python)_<br/>

### Data Analysis <br/>
[Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/s1dewalker/Opening-a-restaurant-in-Germany/blob/main/SQLQuery.sql) <br/>
_(SQL)_ <br/>
[Data Modeling](https://github.com/s1dewalker/Opening-a-restaurant-in-Germany/blob/main/Clustering.ipynb) <br/>
_(K-Mode clustering, Python)_<br/>

### Synthesis <br/>
* __Best option would be to open a cafe, steakhouse or a hybrid steakhouse cafe__
  * __Cafes had the highest average rating and steakhouse had the highest presence in top 1%__
  * __Both had similar competition in the lower end__
* __Only 3% of cuisines were Indian and one-third of them were in the top 1% (Highest)__<br/.

### Reporting and Visualization <br/>
_(Power BI)_<br/>


### After observing the clusters from the map
_(Tableau)_
Few suggestions based on demographic and competition; ignoring budget, accessibility, crime, size and space requirements, or other data that is not available <br/>

Demographics: If your target audience consists of students then consider opening an inexpensive restaurant.<br/>
Competition: If the area has more top-rated and top-ranked restaurants then either avoid or find a way to funnel the people to your location. <br/>

Few examples of points of interest:<br/>
(purple: most top-ranked, most top-rated | red: C rated | green: others)
<br/>
1. Berlin <br/>
A lot of the city has top-class restaurants, especially in the heart of the city. But near Tegel airport there is none. Might need to find a way to attract the audience from these other locations.<br/>

<br/>
2. Munich <br/>
The area around LMU (Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich), TU Munich (Technical University of Munich), and Munich Main Station. Could potentially attract students and other crowds to an inexpensive restaurant.<br/>

<br/>
3. Frankfurt <br/>
Most of the city has top-class restaurants spread all over. Either avoid or find a way to funnel the people to your location.<br/>

<br/>
4. Essen <br/>
Near University of Duisburg-Essen. Most are low-rated/ranked near this location. <br/>

<br/>
5. Stuttgart <br/>
Stuttgart West region has a lack of top-class restaurants.<br/>

<br/>
6. Hannover <br/>
Near the University of Hannover. No top 50 restaurants are nearby. <br/>
